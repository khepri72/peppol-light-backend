# No Design Guidelines Required

This project is a **backend API only** - there is no frontend component to design.

The "peppol-light-backend" is an Express.js REST API that provides:
- Authentication endpoints (register/login)
- Invoice management endpoints (CRUD)
- User management endpoints
- File upload functionality for PDFs
- Airtable database integration

**API projects do not require visual design guidelines** as they have no user interface. The project consists of:
- Server configuration
- Route definitions
- Controller logic
- Middleware functions
- Database connections

If you plan to build a frontend application that consumes this API, please let me know and I'll create comprehensive design guidelines for that separate frontend project. The frontend would likely be a dashboard for managing invoices, users, and viewing uploaded documents.
